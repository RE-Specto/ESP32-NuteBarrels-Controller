bugs:

sonic 0 integer overflow 
[4294948L] [1017mm] [1130ml/mm] [1000mm barrel] [problem:0] [water:0] [nutri:0]

drain webui 0L 30M not displaying barrel ammount (but visible in manual under mutri:303)

some barrel values are still uint16_t but pools are uint32_t - need to evaluate

all functions that adds uint32_t + something and return uint32_t should use UINT32_MAX

manual mixing timer is shown as auto bypass ammount!!
    also not letting to increase auto bypass while in this state
    also manual fill left is shown on barr0 minutes.. (kinda like it actually)

need to prevent bypass to pool0! (or limit until sonic? or until barr size?)

each save on sdcard:
     0 out of 216 Bytes writen. filesize Mismatch.

isChanged will retriger SaveStructs over and over at each start press when Expanders.Protect is set
if (request->hasArg("FullBarrel"))
    sonic full barrel calibration point will create error
        need to save last non-errorous - safeguard range 
    ErrorCheck(barrel, BARREL_SONIC_OUTOFRANGE)
fmsTask sonic 0 timeout after sonic >0 error while storing
    do sonics need time after mux switch?
    try 2 reproduce with hardware
settings not saving automaticly after change from webui - run savestructs
deviation always to high for sonic
    am i measuring sonics too fast?
check if (b->_barrel_height - b->_sonic_last_value) for integer overflow

to implement:
add SaveStructs button to calibration

manual mux unlock via webUI

any way to set/get barrel flow freshwater/nutrients level? not visible in auto ui..

webui zoom in / out -> start/stop!


errorcheck:
    filling, no flow, pressure, try other (+1 or 0 ) solenoid
        flow - previous solenoid error
        noflow + pressure - previous solenoid error
    filling, nopressure
        noflow - fill5 error, or no water supply
        flow - system leak
    mix+drail
        noflow, pressure - solenoid x error
        flow, nopressure - system leak
        noflow, nopressure - pump, power

NutrientsTransferCalc use for nutes from mixer to pools
FreshwaterFillCalc use for freshwater to mixer and pools

SaveSD should fail the parent Setxxx func on failure
search: // just warn for now..

edit fmsd for new simple 1barrel system:


    need f5 together with every fill
    need f6 with every drain

    cleanwater pressure vs pump pressure on the same sensor (_min_pressure _max_pressure)

    Calib5L add timeout!! + add need calib var to trigger? same as manual mode check?
    Relay( usage search

rewrite system to use concentrate from mixer barrel
    [ ]add proper barrel_disabled webui
    [ ] add DrainTotal BypassTotal to webUI + add DrainTotalSet BypassTotalSet
    [ ] if bypass is via manual, how to pause without clearing? via interface?
            edit ResetManual to save value aside instead of clearing

***************^^ checked below here

implement proper logging: https://thingpulse.com/esp32-logging/
    or manually add log levels to serial prints + shorten output format
        +add setting log level to webUI?
        time[000012]line[1732]func[SonicMeasure] message
        [W][T000012][SonicMeasure:1732] message
        split define LOG into LOGERROR LOGWARN .....

check what modem returns if error - if valid check - implement SMS error
sendSMS needs to read AT+OK from Serial2
    if not - cache msg aside to send later??
    cache to file with timestamp
    send later in one message if size < max sms size
    later at what point? check in loop? in event change? in next sendsms?

--------------
upgrade spiffs to littlefs
//#include "SPIFFS.h"
#include <LITTLEFS.h>
#define SPIFFS LITTLEFS

All instances of SPIFFS.read() SPIFFS.write() SPIFFS.close() SPIFFS.open()
are now
LITTLEFS.read() LITTLEFS.write() LITTLEFS.close() LITTLEFS.open()

any way to check for Expander connectivity?
    +hardware check for mux - loopback on leg 14?
        test by serial.write + serial.read ?

change error64 from high sonic measurement error, to high deviation from flow sensor

add flowsetmin flowsetmax at each barrel at webUI 

check & print error states the same way as system states?

barr error set shoud save to sd? or save after each use in code?
    implement error unset from webui

serial print to telnet or to webui directly or via another board (esp8266?).
    try WebSerial https://techtutorialsx.com/2021/01/09/esp32-arduino-webserial/

-solder dummy pressure sensor

manual apply sonic value to flow barrel volume on request.

limit all data from webUI to valid range - ie. no "measure barrel 27"

telnet server to send LOG.prints + telnet client inside webui?

uint16_t DTS = 0;                                              //mySettings.DTS?3600UL:0;
uint16_t timeZone = 3;    

implement mux lock timeout.
    LockMUX should start an external timer and UnlockMUX should stop it

variables that survives reboot?? :)
try RTC_NOINIT_ATTR?

recheck concentration float is accurate
"Do not use float to represent whole numbers."
http://www.cplusplus.com/forum/general/67783/


add to schematic:
12v line add polyfuze
optional: doser on expander x20 pin A7? serial scale mux#14?


optional:
 in serial: "No core dump partition found"
    create coredump part to remove the error
    https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/api-guides/core_dump.html#save-core-dump-to-flash

check all uint values never go below zero!!
    expected in sensor measurements
    anywhere else?

change sonic 10555  to retry--
    BARREL_SONIC_OUTOFRANGE only if all 10555
drain_log file
    needs accurate clock

set Overpressure global error only if error occurs with multiple solenoids

add concentrationSet to barrels for manual?
use filter instead of avearge for sonic?
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10338888/fast-median-filter-in-c-c-for-uint16-2d-array
restore to sd if spiffs date newer? fix timestamp
barrel busy flag?
add option to continue on pressure sensor1 error if flow1 ok
continue on ps2 error if flow2 is in range: 0 < flow2 < "flow2 with no load"
continue on flow error if sonic is rising
continue on sonic error if flow counted barrel volume is ok
continue to next barrel if barrel solenoids error
only unrecoverable errors: pump, main barrel solenoids

handle reset in the middle of flow sensor transfer
    calculate by last values?
    lock thread mux so it executes quick? https://esp32.com/viewtopic.php?t=1703

server.on("/mdns" check mdns broadcast
switchFS add fs check, try to restart filesystem on failure
add ... on serial.available to check module awake
"[E][vfs_api.cpp:22] open(): File system is not mounted" nice error reporting format 

pressure - in next version:
    if overpressure error - set target barrel error
    goto next barrel, clear overpressure error
    if all barrels error - set pump error - clear all barrel overpressure errors
      except manually-disabled barrels "error"
    if no pressure - loop-measure for a while
    if still no pressure - check flow
    no flow - set pump error.

deprecate sonic timeout - use retry count * constant time
