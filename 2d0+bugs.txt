bugs:
fmsTask sonic 0 timeout after sonic >0 error while storing
    do sonics need time after mux switch?
    try 2 reproduce with hardware

to implement:
isFull isEmpty can check flow if sonic error
    work by flow system-wide if sonic error
check: State.SetStoreBarrel(State.FillBarrel()); for bugs
sonic remeasure on high errorÂ±
    ignore the one that is out of range? or remeasure all?

reenable //SaveStructs(); when ready

check & print error states the same way as system states?

barr error set shoud save to sd? or save after each use in code?
    implement error unset from webui

serial print to telnet or to webui directly or via another board (esp8266?).
    try WebSerial https://techtutorialsx.com/2021/01/09/esp32-arduino-webserial/

-solder dummy pressure sensor

work on system hardware - implement all changes to schematic!!

check what modem returns if error - if valid check - implement SMS error

add barrel disable enable WebUI

manual mux unlock via webUI

manual apply sonic value to flow barrel volume on request.

limit all data from webUI to valid range - ie. no "measure barrel 27"

what needed for barrel sonic calibration?
    dry barrel height - SonicOffsetSet
        measure at start
            SonicOffsetSet(barrX,SonicLastMM(barrX));
    how many mililiters is in one milimeter - SonicMLinMM
        fill with exact 100L
            Save100LitersMark
    full  barrel litrage - VolumeMaxSet
        fill untill sonic error
        drain safeguard value
            VolumeMaxSet(barrX, SonicCalcLiters(barrX))
    empty barrel litrage - VolumeMinSet
        drain barrel fully
            VolumeMinSet(barrX, SonicCalcLiters(barrX))
    

WebUI from "1-pump idea test (1).png" file with overlays and jQuery
    https://forum.jquery.com/topic/how-to-change-text-dynamically-svg
telnet server to send LOG.prints + telnet client inside webui?
allow to manually disable a barrel
    barrels.ErrorSet(barrel, BARREL_DISABLED)

uint16_t DTS = 0;                                              //mySettings.DTS?3600UL:0;
uint16_t timeZone = 3;    

implement mux lock timeout.
    LockMUX should start an external timer and UnlockMUX should stop it

variables that survives reboot?? :)
try RTC_NOINIT_ATTR?

recheck concentration float is accurate
"Do not use float to represent whole numbers."
http://www.cplusplus.com/forum/general/67783/


add to schematic:
12v line add polyfuze
optional: doser on expander x20 pin A7? serial scale mux#14?

can we work with bad flow sensor?
    fill works by sonic
    mix works by timer
    store works by sonic
    drain requires flow 









optional:
check all uint values never go below zero!!
    expected in sensor measurements
    anywhere else?

change sonic 10555  to retry--
    BARREL_SONIC_OUTOFRANGE only if all 10555
drain_log file
    needs accurate clock

make pressure sensor check constantly so i can turn off the pump on overpressure
    task loop inside other cpu core? or inside filling loop itself?
    ps2 only when pump working?
    ps1 only once before sol open + once if no flow + once at system start?

set Overpressure global error only if error occurs with multiple solenoids

add concentrationSet to barrels for manual?
use filter instead of avearge for sonic?
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10338888/fast-median-filter-in-c-c-for-uint16-2d-array
restore to sd if spiffs date newer? fix timestamp
barrel busy flag?
add option to continue on pressure sensor1 error if flow1 ok
continue on ps2 error if flow2 is in range: 0 < flow2 < "flow2 with no load"
continue on flow error if sonic is rising
continue on sonic error if flow counted barrel volume is ok
continue to next barrel if barrel solenoids error
only unrecoverable errors: pump, main barrel solenoids

handle reset in the middle of flow sensor transfer
    calculate by last values?
    lock thread mux so it executes quick? https://esp32.com/viewtopic.php?t=1703

server.on("/mdns" check mdns broadcast
switchFS add fs check, try to restart filesystem on failure
add ... on serial.available to check module awake
"[E][vfs_api.cpp:22] open(): File system is not mounted" nice error reporting format 

pressure - in next version:
    if overpressure error - set target barrel error
    goto next barrel, clear overpressure error
    if all barrels error - set pump error - clear all barrel overpressure errors
      except manually-disabled barrels "error"
    if no pressure - loop-measure for a while
    if still no pressure - check flow
    no flow - set pump error.
