bugs:
fmsTask sonic 0 timeout after sonic >0 error while storing
    do sonics need time after mux switch?
pressing Start after manual does not cancel the manual
do Fill Mix Store Drain  SENSOR CHECK pressure.measure will break logic at pressure error?
    need to close taps, wait in loop, and reopen using OpenTaps() once error cleared
    ! also remeasures constantly at Fill first measure if sensor error
system resets every time serial console connects/disconnects?
    https://esp32.com/viewtopic.php?t=4988
void store allways storing untill empty
    must give option to store only required ammount
if mix stopped in the middle - it will count from start again
    separate mix_requirement to requirement and counter
pressure offset is redundant?


to implement:
start should trigger unprotect?
separate manual fmsd from auto
untriger "protect" when pressure sensor back to normal?
    already sheduled below
    add an option to disable sensor checks from WebUI
sonic remeasure on high errorÂ±
    ignore the one that is out of range? or remeasure all?
-my structs
myState (System private) /SysState.bin
fsensor[2] (flow private) /Flow.bin
psensor[2] (pressure private) /Pressure.bin
myBarrel[6] (barrels private) /Barrels.bin

void deleteStructs and webui command in manual

reenable //SaveStructs(); //disabled for mow.... when ready

test:
    fill huge ammount
    mix huge ammount
    fill 0
    fill 6
    store to itself
    store from 0 to 6
    store from 6 to 0
    drain 0
    drain 6

barr error set shoud save to sd? or save after each use in code?
    implement error unset from webui

serial print to telnet or to webui directly or via another board (esp8266?).

-solder dummy pressure sensor

!!! add a way to reset pressure error "protect" mode - by pressing start?
    use void pressure_sensor::ErrorReset(byte sens)

---- checked untill here ----

start/stop interrupts "use start-stop actions from evernote!" 
    start sets canMix global boolean? 
    if stopped also pressed - do something else
    if status = stopped: clear stopped. else if no status: set mixing. else do start-button extra action
        task or loop reads the bool - changes RGB immediately, but start mixing task only when no tasks running
    stop sets shouldStop global boolean?
    if start also pressed - do something else
    if status not stopped - set stopped + save. else save + extra stopped action
        task or loop reads the bool - changes RGB immediately, triggers stop and save
    on stop:     pressure.SaveSD(); flow.SaveSD();
    // can set the bool to !bool to check if pressed twice - for reset and other system tasks


work on system hardware - implement all changes to schematic!!
change zeners to 3.3v? - check new zeners that arrived

check what modem returns if error - if valid check - implement SMS error

add calibration edit for all sensors to manual: 
use separate <forms> for each one?
    SystemState.state_set
    SystemState.state_unset
    SystemState.error_set
    SystemState.error_unset
    flow.MultSet(sens,mult)
    pressure.DividerSet

    barrels.ErrorUnset
    barrels.ErrorReset
    barrels.SonicOffsetSet
    barrels.SonicMLinMMSet
    Settings.prefill_requirement
    Settings.afterfill_requirement deprecate??
    Settings.mix_requirement
    Settings.drain_requirement
    Settings.filling_barrel
    Settings.storing_barrel
    NTP Timezone + DTS

manual apply sonic value to flow barrel volume on request.

WebUI from "1-pump idea test (1).png" file with overlays and jQuery
    https://forum.jquery.com/topic/how-to-change-text-dynamically-svg
telnet server to send LOG.prints + telnet client inside webui?
allow to manually disable a barrel
    barrels.ErrorSet(barrel, BARREL_DISABLED)

fmsTask - check fill mix if barrel 0 not error!? 
    who can set barrel 0 error?

------------------------------

uint16_t DTS = 0;                                              //mySettings.DTS?3600UL:0;
uint16_t timeZone = 3;    

limit all data from webUI to valid range - ie. no "measure barrel 27"

variables that survives reboot?? :)
try RTC_NOINIT_ATTR?
https://github.com/highno/rtcvars/issues/3

recheck concentration float is accurate
"Do not use float to represent whole numbers."
http://www.cplusplus.com/forum/general/67783/
    check my possible ranges:
    test on another esp32
concentration float check if ok.

make pressure sensor check constantly so i can turn off the pump on overpressure
    task loop inside other cpu core? or inside filling loop itself?
    ps2 only when pump working?
    ps1 only once before sol open + once if no flow + once at system start?

reset all sensor values on system start? flow only? or remeber who to assing to and assign on start?
    is it important at all? how much water can flow between assignments?

deprecate RTC? replace with ntp + timeAlarms?

set Overpressure global error only if error occurs with multiple solenoids

check all uint values never go below zero!!
    expected in sensor measurements
    anywhere else?

implement mux lock timeout.
    LockMUX should start an external timer and UnlockMUX should stop it
    manual unlock via webUI

measure all sonic on system start so sonic have all values ready?

change sonic 10555  to retry--
    BARREL_SONIC_OUTOFRANGE only if all 10555

handle reset in the middle of flow sensor transfer
    calculate by last values?
    lock thread mux so it executes quick? https://esp32.com/viewtopic.php?t=1703

deprecate error reporting task and sendsms dictionary?

add to schematic:
12v to 5v change to switching regulator? move power supply out of the main board?
12v line add polyfuze
optional: doser on expander x20 pin A7? serial scale mux#14?


optional:
drain_log file
    needs accurate clock
add LOG.println(__FUNCTION__); at every function start for debug

add concentrationSet to barrels for manual?
use filter instead of avearge for sonic?
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10338888/fast-median-filter-in-c-c-for-uint16-2d-array
restore to sd if spiffs date newer? fix timestamp
barrel busy flag?
add option to continue on pressure sensor1 error if flow1 ok
continue on ps2 error if flow2 is in range: 0 < flow2 < "flow2 with no load"
continue on flow error if sonic is rising
continue on sonic error if flow counted barrel volume is ok
continue to next barrel if barrel solenoids error
only unrecoverable errors: pump, main barrel solenoids
add start-stop from webUI

server.on("/mdns" check mdns broadcast
switchFS add fs check, try to restart filesystem on failure
add ... on serial.available to check module awake
"[E][vfs_api.cpp:22] open(): File system is not mounted" nice error reporting format 

// pressure - in next version:
//if overpressure error - set target barrel error
//goto next barrel, clear overpressure error
//if all barrels error - set pump error - clear all barrel overpressure errors
//  except manually-disabled barrels "error"
//if no pressure - loop-measure for a while
//if still no pressure - check flow
//no flow - set pump error.
